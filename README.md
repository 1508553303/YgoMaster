## Features

- Create decks
- Open packs
- Solo content
- Custom duels (by replacing the first chapter - see `CustomDuel.json`)
- ydk support

Online functionality is not implemented.

## Usage

Compile `YgoMaster.sln` and `YgoMasterLoader.cpp` (for the cpp read the top of the file).

Copy the `Build` folder (the folder, not the contents of the folder) into the game folder and run `YgoMaster.exe` / `YgoMasterClient.exe`.

*You need to fully download the game via Steam and use the same language setting as set on there. If these requirements aren't met you'll get a popup with the text "FILE LOAD ERROR".*
