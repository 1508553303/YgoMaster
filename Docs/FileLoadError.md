# Loading errors

![Alt text](Pics/LoadError.jpg)

You may see some variation of the above error or infinite loading screens, corrupt screens, etc

## Game not updated / multiple folders inside of LocalData

Fully update your game. If you have multiple folders inside of LocalData (which is a folder inside of your Master Duel folder), you need to make sure they are ALL updated or delete the ones which aren't updated.

## Changing language

- Change the language on the Steam version of the game (the setting is under a sub menu at the top right of the home screen)
- You will get sent back to the title screen
- Click through to the home screen which will download the language files
- Close the game and open YgoMaster

## Note

- To update your game you need to go the home screen of the game using Steam. The home screen is the screen where it shows your duelist name and level in the top left of the screen.
- Support is not provided beyond these instructions as these are the only known ways of fixing these issues.
