# Loading errors

![Alt text](Pics/LoadError.jpg)

You may see some variation of the above error or infinite loading screens, corrupt screens, etc

## Game not updated / multiple folders inside of LocalData

Fully update your game. If you have multiple folders inside of LocalData (which is a folder inside of your Master Duel folder), you need to make sure they are ALL updated or delete the ones which aren't updated.

## Changing language

To change the language of the game you will need to set the language on the Steam version of the game, reopen the game using Steam, then follow the above `LocalSave` steps, and then finally open YgoMaster. If this doesn't work you can try the following which is an example of setting the language to Chinese:

- Launch the game via Steam and change the language to English.
- Launch the game again via Steam to ensure all language files are fully downloaded.
- Next, load the game using YgoMaster (the game should start normally at this point).
- Change the language settings to your desired language, for example, Chinese, from within the game.
- Return to the startup page; you should receive a prompt indicating a file loading error.
- Subsequently, launch the game via Steam and change the language to Chinese.
- Once all language files are fully downloaded, you should be able to load the game using YgoMaster.

## Note

- To update your game you need to go the home screen of the game using Steam. The home screen is the screen where it shows your duelist name and level in the top left of the screen.
- Support is not provided beyond these instructions as these are the only known ways of fixing these issues.
