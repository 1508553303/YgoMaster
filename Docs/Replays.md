## Duel replays

Replays will auto save into `Data/Players/XXXXXX/Replays/`.

Auto saved files are given a numeric name. When you reach the save limit it will start deleting auto saved files by their creation date. The save limit is defined by `DuelReplaySaveFileLimit` in `Data/Settings.json`. Only numeric file names count towards the auto save file limit.

If you would like to keep a replay file forever simply rename the file to a non-numeric name (e.g. letters / letters and numbers).
